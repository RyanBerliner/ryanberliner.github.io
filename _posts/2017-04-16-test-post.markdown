I've known my name.com was available for a while, and I figured I should get it while I can. I am not sure what I will do
with this site yet, but right now it's just hosted for free on github pages and is built with [jekyll][jekyll-gh].

If you know anything about jekyll than you probably already knew I am using it, cause I haven't changed the default theme much.  I've
never used it before, but it does exactly what I need since any server side language won't work on github pages.
