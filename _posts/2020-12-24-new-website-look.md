I gave my website a new look. I wanted to get rid of all extra styling.
However, alot of the old blog posts use bootstrap classes and would look pretty bad if I
got rid of it. There are a couple ways this could have been handled, but I decided that 
those old posts will just load with the old theme.


You'll notice if you click on any of the old blog posts they load exactly as they did before
the update. Then I don't need to worry about stuff breaking. As an example, look at
[this old post about the last time I updated my site](/jekyll-site-upgraded-to-bootstrap) over
3 years ago.

While this new look doesn't have much going for it, it should be future proofed.
