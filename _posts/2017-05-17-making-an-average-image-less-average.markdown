I just realized that it has been a very long time since the last time I touched
photoshop or my gopro. I enjoy that kind of stuff so I thought I just mess around
with an old photo. I'll be taking screenshots as I touch it up, so expect this to
be a little scatter brained.

For this I am going to use a photo from either summer/fall because of a couple reasons.
Photos with snow don't require much most of the time (make sure the snow is bright,
highlight the lighting) and all of the photos I have from spring suck. They are just grey.
It's usually cloudy, and nothing is green yet. They aren't average photos, they
are bad photos. So, I'll do some combing through old photos...
