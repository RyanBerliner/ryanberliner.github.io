<p>
	For a class at UVM, we needed to create a final project with a Raspberry Pi. I was
	running out of ideas and time to come up with them, so I decided to settle on
	running LEDs off of it, but to make it not boring the LEDs would integrate with
	other applications. The first integration I implemented was Github.
</p>

<div id="daily-pi">
	<p>
		I'll give an overview of what it looks like, and how Github activity affects
		the LEDs, then I'll go into more detail about how it does it later. First, here
		is what the LEDs look like 'idle'.
	</p>
	<img src="/img/2017-11/daily-pi-green.jpg" alt="LEDs powered by a Raspberry Pi, attatched to a desk." class="mb-4">
	<p>
		The 'idle' color can be easily changed online (again, more on this later),
		but green seemed to make for the coolest photo. Realistically though, It's
		a bit hard to do alot of work with the LEDs like this. They seem super bright
		in the picture, and they're just as bright in person. It can make your eyes
		wig out a little. I have found that having them set to a duller, warm white
		(pretty much like a soft white/warm light bulb) gives a really nice suble light.
		When I push to a repository on github, the lights will pulse with Github purple.

	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-12">
			<p>
				There is also a web page that keeps track of all the activities that make
				the lights pulse. Right now, that's just github pushes. It just says the
				time and the number of commits that I pushed. The purple printed on the
				website and the purple pulsing the leds both come from the same source...
				so the thought is that as I want I can add more integrations to more services
				and they'll each have there own color.
			</p>
			<p>
				The website itself doesn't do anything fancing. It polls the database for new
				activity every couple seconds and updates the screen, so no need to refresh.
				I don't see myself really using this at all, but it aids as a visual representation
				of whats happening behind the scenes. It also gives me another checkpoint when
				for debugging when problems come about.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each night at 2am, all activities from the previous day are deleted, because
				there isn't really any point in holding on to them for longer than that.

	<h2>How It Works:</h2>
	<p>
		Now I'll go into some more of the details about how it works. Starting out broad, and getting more specific, let's
		start with the general process.
