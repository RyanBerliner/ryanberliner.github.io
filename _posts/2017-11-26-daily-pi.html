<div id="daily-pi">
	<p>
		For a class at UVM, we needed to create a final project with a Raspberry Pi. I was
		running out of ideas and time to come up with them, so I decided to settle on
		running LEDs off of it, but to make it not boring the LEDs would integrate with
		other applications. The first integration I implemented was Github.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'll give an overview of what it looks like, and how Github activity affects
		the LEDs, then I'll go into more detail about how it does it later. First, here
		is what the LEDs look like 'idle'.

		The 'idle' color can be easily changed online (again, more on this later),
		but green seemed to make for the coolest photo. Realistically though, It's
		a bit hard to do alot of work with the LEDs like this. They seem super bright
		in the picture, and they're just as bright in person. It can make your eyes
		wig out a little. I have found that having them set to a duller, warm white
		(pretty much like a soft white/warm light bulb) gives a really nice suble light.
		When I push to a repository on github, the lights will pulse with Github purple.
