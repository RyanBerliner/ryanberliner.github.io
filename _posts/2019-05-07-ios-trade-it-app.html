<p>
  Just like the android class I took last semester, I took an iOS one this semester. Me and 4 others
  created this app where UVM students would be able to buy and sell their items with each other.
</p>

<p>
  The app was written in swift, and the backend was written in python. We were all sick of PHP so we decided to
  do something different that we haven't done yet. We decided on using Flask, and we hosted it on heroku.
  Images are uploaded to an S3 bucket, in both a 'large' and 'small' size. This is mostly so we could shrink the photos
  enough that we didn't have to worry about coming anywhere close to exceeding free teir usage limits.
</p>

<p>
  Turned out pretty cool, does everything we set out to in this version.
