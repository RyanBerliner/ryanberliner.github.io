<p>
  I just realized that it has been a very long time since the last time I touched
  photoshop or my gopro. I enjoy that kind of stuff so I thought I just mess around
  with an old photo. I'll be taking screenshots as I touch it up, so expect this to
  be a little scatter brained.

    For this I am going to use a photo from either summer/fall because of a couple reasons.
    Photos with snow don't require much most of the time (make sure the snow is white and bright,
    highlight the lighting) and all of the photos I have from spring suck. They are just grey.
    It's usually cloudy, and nothing is green yet. They aren't average photos, they
    are bad photos. So, I'll do some combing through old photos...

![The image that I chose]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/2017-05/colorado-1.jpg)

This picture was taken in 2009 i Aspen, Colorado. The camera was the origional Gopro HD Hero,
so definitely nothing fancy considering it's now 2017 and we are now on the Hero 5. As you
can see at the bottom of that screenshot the resolution and file size aren't great either.
I would call this a pretty average photo. Right off the bat there are a couple of things that
I notice and want to address.

* Straighten out the trees and horizon (handlebars).
* The sky and trees on the right looks pretty good. The detail is more or less still there.
However the sky on the left (the clouds specifically) have no detail left in them. I
don't want to try and get the detail out of it, because it's not there, it'll just look grey,
not good. The best bet here may be to to brighten that part and make that light source stronger.
Looks like that is where the sun was coming from.
* Some of the light hitting the the trail blew it out a little bit, but not completely which
is good. I don't think it's a good call to get rid of the light variation here, but just
bring back some of the detail there.
* Level out the white balance and green/magenta a bit. I know my shifter on the right is grey,
so I'll probably base it mostly off of that.
* Pump up the saturation in areas it makes sense. For instance the green is looking a little bit dull.

Starting with general adjustments, I'll open it up in bridge.
