[Vermont Land Boundaries](https://vermontlandboundaries.com), an app to view Vermont parcel data on your phone for free, is now available on the Google Play Store. It released initially on the iOS App Store for iPhones about a month back, and after some testing there is now on Google Play as well.

This is a [react native](https://reactnative.dev/) app, so not much needed to be done to do this. There where a few styling oddities on android that needed to be fixed, but most of the work was adding android icons and getting it built properly for the Google Play store.

If you'd like to download this app to view parcel data in Vermont on your phone, search your app store, or refer to the [Vermont Land Boundaries](https://vermontlandboundaries.com) website for more information.
